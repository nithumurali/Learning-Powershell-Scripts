# Learning-Powershell-Scripts

Hi there!

This is my personal learning space where I'm practicing small scripts, troubleshooting ideas, and building my skills in IT operations, cloud security, and automation.

I'm currently focusing on:

PowerShell basics for system health checks, automation tasks, and IT support scenarios

Python basics for scripting, small automations, and security use cases

Concepts from Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, and cloud app security

I'm sharing this journey openly, not because it's perfect, but because every small step forward matters.

One day, these tiny scripts and notes will grow into bigger projects.
For now, this is where it all begins.

Thanks for stopping by!
